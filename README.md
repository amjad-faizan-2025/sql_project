# SQL Portfolio Project - Stack Overflow Post Analysis

# Overview
This project analyzes the history of Stack Overflow posts, including edits, comments, and other changes, to gain insights into user activity and content evolution while mastering SQL skills.

# Project Objective
The main goal of this project was to extract meaningful insights from Stack Overflow data by leveraging SQL queries. The project involved analyzing posts, votes, comments, and user interactions to uncover trends and patterns.

# Data Source
The dataset consists of Stack Overflow post data, including:
•	Posts and their attributes (e.g., score, creation date, type)
•	Comments and user interactions
•	Edits made to posts
•	Voting patterns
•	User information (e.g., reputation, badges earned)

# Key Findings
•	Post ID 2010 had the highest score in the year 2023.
•	Post IDs 2009 and 2010 were the highest-scoring posts in categories ‘SQL Aggregate Functions’ and ‘Introduction to SQL Window Functions,’ respectively.
•	Posts 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2005 each received two votes.
•	Users 1001 (Alice) and 1002 (Bob) commented and edited posts three times each.
•	Alice earned the highest number of badges (4 in total).
•	Gold Contributor badges were the most commonly earned (4 times).
•	The SQL tag was associated with the highest-scoring posts (7 posts with a total score of 225).
•	User Dave (ID 1004) had the highest average post score of 30.
•	User Frank (ID 1006) had the highest reputation of 2000.

# SQL Concepts Used
This project utilized various SQL techniques, including:
•	Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.) to combine related data.
•	Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for modular and readable queries.
•	Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.) to summarize data.
•	Window Functions to analyze ranking and trends over time.
•	Subqueries for complex filtering and calculations.
